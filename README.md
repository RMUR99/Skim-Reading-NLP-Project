At last I can share a NLP project showcase ! 
#  Introducing Skimmer ‚öïÔ∏èüìë 
Skimmer comes from the `Skim Reading` which means to read things quicker 
I have implemented both on my local machine and Google Colab  ( I will list Guides link and limitation in the end ) 

The objective of the project is to take articles from pubmed ( they must be in RCT format ) which are hard to read to a skimmed version that is easy to understand 

This project uses Tensor flow , Numpy , pandas 

This project showcase how you can tokenize texts ( which means turn text to Tensors , numerical data ) , including embedding sentences , characters , and then positions and length of each sentence 

# The notebook shows you all the steps needed to set up the project

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Important notes : 
 ‚ó¶ Setting up Jupyter Notebook locally will take so much GPU power so be mindful 
 ‚ó¶ If you want to set up Jupyter Notebooks on VScode I have a guide here : https://github.com/RMUR99/Dog-Breed-Identifier-
 ‚ó¶ During coding on both VScode and Google colab each one had limitation for instance I had to downgrade my tensorflow to 2.8 in order to proceed in running cells 
 ‚ó¶ GPU can be running locally only with tensorflow 2.10 
 ‚ó¶ While pushing the repo the model was too huge to put so but it will be made when u run the cells
